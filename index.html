        <img src="assets/images/doughnuts.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Doughnut Bath">
        <p>Although currently living in Salt Lake City, Utah, Libby moved all over the Western U.S. during her formative years and has many hometowns including Portland, Oregon, Phoenix, Arizona, and Houston, Texas. Libby is presently employed as a case manager at The Road Home, the state's largest homeless shelter, but is looking to start a new chapter with a career in web development.</p>
        <p>In addition to coding, Libby loves getting lost in a good book, cross-stitching feminist figures and sayings, and playing with her cat, Merry. Libby also loves to travel and has a full passport as well as a litany of stories to tell about her journeys. A bucket list item she hopes to cross off next is traversing El Santiago de Compostela in Spain.</p>
